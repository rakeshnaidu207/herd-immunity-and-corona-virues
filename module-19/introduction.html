<h1>introduction</h1>
<P>coronavirus has first emerged in the province of hubei,china,in latedecember 2019.andthe cotagious form of disease covered the whole worldby the rapid spread.
  as of july 12,2020, there are 12,879,107 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease,and 5,68,422 deaths were reported globally.
  however,after its first appearance in china, the united states of america and europe were worst hit by covid-19 and emerged as the epic center of disease.
  contact tranmission, the severity of the disease, and unavailability of specific therapeutics make covid-19 more deadly than previous other viral outbreaks.
  and it seems to be the disease of the centuyr.SARS-COV-2 transmission occurs via the respiratory droplets produced during coughing,sneezing,and talking.
  the nuclei of the droplets contain viral particales that can remain viable in aerosols for up to 3hrs and can infect the individual if inhaled or indirectly via the touch of contaminated objects.
  aithough,health-care authorities and vaccine industries are searching for specific and effective therapies to prevent community transmission of covid-19
  apart from western medicine policymakers and the scientific world are also looking for alternative medicine and some-how they have shown some level of protection in china and india.
  in such a health emergency when the entire world is suffering from covid-19 a vaccine is the only hope.
  anad according to  world health organization 110 vaccine candidates are under development and 10 vaccine candidates are part of the human trails.
