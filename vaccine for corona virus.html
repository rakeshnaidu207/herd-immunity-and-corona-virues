        <h1>vaccine for caronavirues</h1>
        <p>There are 321 vaccine candidates in development stage
            Among this 39 vaccine candidates are in clinical research and 33 in phase 1-2 trails and 6 in phase 2-3 trails
            The world health organization and coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations and gates foundation will provide money for the research and development  of corona vaccine
            </p>
        <h1>corona vaccine in India</h1>    
         <p>The World Health Organization has listed Serum Institute of India, Zydus Cadila, Indian Immunologicals Limited and Bharat Biotech from India among the firms involved in developing a vaccine.

            Leading virologist Shahid Jameel said India's vaccine manufacturing capacity is quite remarkable and at least three Indian companies - Serum Institute, Bharat Biotech and Biologicals E are at the forefont, working with international partners to manufacture a vaccine for COVID-19.
            
            "Research on a COVID vaccine in India is at a very early stage of development and any candidates are likely to reach animal trials only by the end of the year," he said.
            
            However, Indian vaccine companies have a lot of capacity and expertise, and are likely to play a significant role in bringing new COVID-19 vaccines to the market.</p>
